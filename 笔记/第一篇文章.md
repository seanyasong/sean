### about english

    起初，我对英语是没有兴趣的，为什么呢？可能是因为我上学的时候我爸爸逼着我学英语，我能记得那段时间是很痛苦的。那时候才上初一，每天早上起床，自己去跑步，有时可能会被老爸追上，因为他也有早起跑步的习惯，我的习惯是被我爸培养起来的。
    跑步完之后我会被叫到我爸的办公室，他是我们学校的教导主任，所以有一间自己的办公室，在办公桌上有一杯已经泡好的牛奶，我喝完之后开始我每天都要做的事情学习英语。开始的时候这件事情让我非常痛苦，不过现在回头看看，我非常感谢我的父亲。
    At first, I was not interested in English, why? Probably because my dad forced me to learn English when I was in school, and I can remember it was a very painful time. At that time, it was only the first year of junior high school. I got up every morning and went for a run by myself. Sometimes my dad might catch up, because he also had the habit of getting up early to run. My habit was cultivated by my dad.
     After the run, I will be called to my dad's office. He is the dean of our school, so I have an office of my own. There is a glass of brewed milk on the desk. After I finish drinking, I start learning English, which is what I do every day. It hurt me so much in the beginning, but looking back now, I'm very grateful to my dad.
